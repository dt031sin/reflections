When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Ans. When i need to access it from different locations or to share it with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Ans. Manual pull gives more control and it does not make changes automatically when someone changes the remote repository.
