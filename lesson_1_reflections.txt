How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

Ans. It can be used to check what changes we made and easier to point out newly created mistakes in the 
file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

Ans. By enabling me to check previous versions at any point of time, so i can what changes i made and 
what effect they had, be it better or worse.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Ans. Pros: U get to decide, more control over commits, properly timed. Cons: Have to do it manually everytime we make a significant change.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Ans. Git controls a whole repository and treats the whole repository as a whole and therefore commits all the files together. Docs have documents which may or may not be a part of a single program, so it treats them individually.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Ans. Git log lists all the commits on a repository while git diff lists the differences between two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

Ans. If we break something in our code, with version control we have confidence that we return back to a previous working version of that code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Ans. For my Projects on Android.
